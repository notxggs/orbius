  ## Overview

  Orbius is a powerful, modular Discord bot engineered for performance and extensibility. It supports both **prefix commands** and **slash commands**, backed by a persistent **MongoDB** database. Every feature is purpose-built with clean separation between commands, events, and data layers.

  ## Features

  ### Invite Tracking
  Track every invite in your server with precision.

  - Identify who invited each member
  - Separate counters for **joins**, **leaves**, **rejoins**, and **fake invites** (bots or young accounts)
  - Set custom **join and leave message channels** with rich template variables
  - Manually adjust invite counts per user — add, remove, clear, or reset

  ### Giveaways
  Run clean and fair giveaways.

  - Create giveaways with a custom prize, duration, and winner count
  - End giveaways early at any time
  - Reroll winners with a single command
  - Reaction-based entry system powered by Discord's native reactions

  ### Timers
  Server-side timers that persist across restarts.

  - Start a named timer with a custom duration and optional message
  - Pause, resume, and end timers at will
  - Useful for events, competitions, or time-boxed activities

  ### Greet Messages
  A fully customisable welcome system.

  - Configure up to **3 separate greet channels** per server
  - Two greet modes:
    - **Simple** — plain text message with variable support
    - **Container** — rich UI with title, description, thumbnail, banner image, and accent colour
  - Set greet messages to **auto-delete** after a configurable number of seconds
  - Built-in variable system for dynamic content

  ### Moderation
  Essential tools to keep your server in order.

  - Ban and unban members
